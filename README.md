Version 1:
This application is an "Archaic/Simplistic" Version of Facebook that is executed in the terminal.
It is expected to be able to store and pull data through constructors.

- FacebookLite is the user defined class.

- Declare/Initialize an object of this class by calling the constructor and providing 2 arguments: name, age.

Terminal:
Compile: "javac FacebookLite.java Driver.java"
Run: "java Driver"
